## Description
    
Workout Tracker is a web application that lets anyone create and track daily workouts. Multiple exercises can be logged for any given day, with tracking of the exercise details such as type, weight, sets, reps and duration. Additionally, cardio exercises can track total distance.

This application's front end code was already provided. However, the Mongo database along with the Mongoose schema and routes with Express still needed to be created.
